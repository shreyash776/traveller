## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```
traveler-website/
‚îÇ   index.html          # The main HTML file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ   travel.css           # The main CSS file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ   images/             # Directory for storing images
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ   travel.js

```

- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that contains the structure and content of the website.
- `travel.css`: The main CSS file for styling the website.
- `images/`: A directory to store all the images used in the website.
- `travel.js`: If you decide to add interactivity to your website with JavaScript, you can place your JavaScript files here.
